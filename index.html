            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <img src="assets/images/nate1.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Nate Bennett">

            <p>I grew up in Edmonds, WA and I started having an interest in technology at a young age. I played a lot of computer games in my dad's home office growing up which taught me math skills and game theory. Games like Math Blaster, Mavis Beacon, and Encarta's Mindmaze. In high school I also took computer driven courses like a beginner webpage design class and many other Microsoft Office related courses. </p>

            <p>I am now 32 years old and I live in downtown Seattle, WA working as an Accountant at an Engineering Firm.  I have 9 years of experience in my field, but have always felt that my skillset could be used elsewhere.  That is where coding school comes in.  I finally pulled the trigger after a year of putting off my decision.  And I am so glad I did it!</p>
                
            <p>In my free time I love to go downhill skiing in the winter and overnight backpacking in the summertime.  I also have played on various intermural teams for indoor soccer, flag football, basketball, and softball.  You could say I am an avid lover of sports!</p>
